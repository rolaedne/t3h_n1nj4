* juicier animations avalable for everything
* vertical scrolling
* scroll-back (left/right scrolling, up/down scrolling)
* auto-scroll levels? (tower climb, etc)
* intentional wall climb
* enemy wall climb support?
* gibs
* destructable environmental objects
* directional attacks (4 way? 8 way?)
* different main weapon support (spears? dual wield katanas?)
* better physics/graphics integration (don't leave parts hanging over edges because a small piece has a collision)
* boss fights?
* world objects
* multi-layer graphics: background, background objects, world objects, foreground, foreground objects (animations available to all objects)
* parallax scrolling?
* non-uniform player/enemy sizes (don't be tied to the current tile size)
* more granular tiles (collision)
* support for non-uniform collidable blocks
* decouple animations/physics/etc from frame rate
* object to object collisions/physics (e.g., stars can hit boxes of different types with different effects)
* generalize damage/etc from object collisions/physics instead of explicitly checking specific types of collisions for "killing"
* SDL2 support (DONE)
* gamepad support
* web port?
* android/ios port?
* multiplayer (split screen, multi-window?)
* text support
* generalized "movie" support (e.g., don't hardcode things like the intro movie, let them be driven by data)
* load enemies from data files
* load tiles from data files (tile types, dimensions, properties (danger edges, etc))
* move world data into data files
* allow lava/fire to spawn fire/ash particles
* add support for basic scale-up/down for images
* add support for auto-90 degree rotations for images
* add support for auto-45 degree rotations for images
* allow enemies/objects to be built out of composite collision targets and animated parts
* allow player to be built out of composite collision targets and animated parts
* BUG: star/fire attacks shouldn't shift vertically on vertical scroll (should have consistent world coordinates, not affected by screen coords)
* FEATURE: allow multiple keys mapped to same action (e.g., WASD + arrow keys)
